				<p>I.ED, an editorial-based content application created for students at the European Institute of Design IED in Rio, Brazil.</p>
				<p>It is supported on the following tripod: limited, curated, and personalized information. The scope is to eliminate and/or reduce some of the obstacles that students of  encounter when trying to perform a task: to study, in particular, through the reading of texts online. The aim is to mitigate the problem of students' lack of time, which negatively affects studies, productivity, efficacy and communication. To do this, we tried to avoid the dispersion and distraction of users, presenting the contents in an application with minimal interface and progressive disclosure and with quick and easy access to the main contents, thanks also to an efficient system of indexing and searching for books.</p> 
				<p>This project was developed together with Thiago Giammattey.</p>
