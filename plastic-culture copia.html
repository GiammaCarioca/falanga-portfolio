			<h2>#PlasticCulture</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="subtitle">The reason why contemporary pop culture is blonde and why we like it so much.</h2><br>
			<span class="article">During the last 50 years electronic media such as radio, television and today the Internet have covered the globe and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives. They extend their influence upon our culture, our behavior, our view, our community and our country. Through media the advertising industry is moulding consumers for profit.</span><br>
			<span>This project deals with the effects of mass media and advertising on contemporary popular culture and how they affect consumer behaviors and psychological reactance over a long­term period. Often the general public is not aware of these effects, therefore as a communication designer, I feel responsible for filling this awareness gap.</span><br>
			<span>The project invites the audience to perceive contemporary pop culture in a stereotypical way as being attractive but shallow; and define our contemporary popular culture as a Plastic Culture, meant as “capable of being shaped or extruded in a variety of shapes”.</span></p>
